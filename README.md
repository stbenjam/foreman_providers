# ForemanProviders

Adds ManageIQ Providers and Inventory to Foreman

## Installation

Clone the provider plugins:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agrare/foreman_providers.git
git clone https://github.com/agrare/foreman_providers_infra.git
git clone https://github.com/agrare/foreman_providers_ovirt.git
```

Add the provider plugins to your Foreman bundler.d/ directory:

```bash
echo 'gem "ovirt" # require the ovirt gem early to workaround issues with rbovirt
gem "foreman_providers",      :path => "../foreman_providers"
gem "foreman_providers_infra, :path => "../foreman_providers_infra"
gem "foreman_providers_ovirt, :path => "../foreman_providers_ovirt"' > bundler.d/provider.rb
```

Update your foreman gems and database

```bash
bundle update
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

Add a new Ovirt ComputeResource and a new Provider will be automatically created for you

Refresh your provider inventory

```bash
bin/rails runner 'Providers::Ovirt::Manager.first.refresh'
```

This should automatically create managed hosts from the Ovirt Hosts and VMs in your inventory.

Additionally there may be more VMs that aren't listed if they don't have an IP address that was detected.

These VMs are in the `Providers::Infra::Vm` model, templates are in the `Providers::Infra::Template` model, and hosts in (wait for it) `Providers::Infra::Host`.
